wiki content is stored only on devices that view it

when viewing a wiki, you will have the latest info your device has seen from yours and others' contributions

unlike wikipedia, there is no central, authoritative store of information, so every device is automatically a full backup others can restore their copy of a wiki from simply by being online together
 
the users of a wiki share the responsibilities of storage and bandwidth for distributing it
