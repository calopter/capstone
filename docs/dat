to sync between users directly and minimize relying on centralized servers, trieWiki uses [the dat protocol](https://docs.dat.foundation/docs/intro)

**to share a wiki:**
- click `index` in the navigation bar
- copy and share the key
- anyone who enters this key can
  - load pages from others who are connected
  - edit anything in the wiki
  - have edits spread to others who connect!


- the peer count in the right of navigation bar shows your current connections
- when a peer has connected, you should see their 'fingerprint' page appear in your index
